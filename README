Kif is a collection of scripts built to attack an OpenStack cloud
deployment. This was initially built from OpenStack Security Notes
(OSSNS).

Currently the conf/ directory holds YAML files outlining service
configuration files and options that may be useful to an attacker.
These will used by the parse_server_configs.py file.

The modules/ directory contain the attack scripts, each of which
is at varying levels of completion.

Next steps are to get parse_server_configs.py working, determine
what types of tags to add to the modules/ attacks, and complete
attack scripts that are "mostly done".
